            <br />
           Hi, Examination System is a technology-driven way to simplify examination activities like defining exam
            patterns with question banks, defining exam timers, objective/subjective question sections, and conducting
            exams using a computer or mobile devices in a paperless manner.
            <br />
            <br />
            Online Examination System is a cost-effective, scalable way to convert traditional pen and paper-based exams
            to online and paperless mode. Candidates can appear for the exam using any desktop, laptop, or mobile device
            with a browser. Exam results can be generated instantly for the objective type of questions.
            <br />
            <br />
            It can simplify overall examination management and result generation activity.
